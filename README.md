# Educational Remote Access Tool (RAT)
# Disclaimer: This project is for educational and research purposes only.

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Remote Access Tool (RAT) designed to help cybersecurity enthusiasts, developers, and students understand how such tools work from a technical perspective. The primary goal of this project is to:

Promote awareness about the functionality and potential risks of RATs.
Educate developers on secure coding practices by showcasing how vulnerabilities can be exploited.
Encourage ethical behavior in cybersecurity and software development.
# Important Notes:
Ethical Use Only: This tool is provided solely for educational and ethical research purposes. It must not be used for any unauthorized or malicious activities.
Consent Required: Always obtain explicit permission before using this tool on any system.
No Malicious Intent: The code does not contain features designed for covert or malicious activities. It is intended as a learning resource.
# Learning Objectives:
Understand how RATs establish communication between a client and a server.
Explore techniques used in network programming and data transmission.
Learn about security countermeasures to prevent exploitation by malicious RATs.
Contribution to Cybersecurity:
By studying and understanding tools like this, individuals can gain insights into potential attack vectors and develop stronger defensive strategies, contributing to a safer and more secure internet.
